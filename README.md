# Our prominent features:

We are having an input function that tests if the input is valid or not instead of validating the input every time we needed an input from the user.
The Doctor adds his available times into the system that include information (day name, starting and ending working hours, his breaks....etc.), the doctor is allowed to remove his times or edit any specific aspect in his working days, in response our system notifies him if his actions will affect the patients that booked at this time, as well as checks if his data is valid before saving it.    
As a patient you may book an appointment through several ways such as choosing a certain day name or date to book at.
For example if the patient wants a certain date to book at, the system asks him to type 
the date, (surely) if it's a previous/invalid date the system notifies the user.
After the user enters the desired date for booking, the system converts it to its corresponding day name. So for example if the users desired date is "12/3/2024" the system knows that its corresponding day is Tuesday.
By this method we are having a really optimized storage (memory) as we are not having memory space telling us that "12/3/2024" is Tuesday, instead we are having a function that calculates it for us. So the only way to allocate an appointment in memory is to book it!  ‚ú®üôÇ
There's another way to book an appointment which is by typing the desired doctor's username, our program displays (instantaneously/without clicking the enter button) the possible desired doctors.
